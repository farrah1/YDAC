## 1: Ice Breaker
Worst Idea
"The technique is simple: Ask the group to create a list of bad, terrible, stupid, illegal or gross ideas. It's a fun way to get people's creative juices flowing and get participation. Nobody gets too worried about saying something stupid when that's the whole point of the exercise. And when you've already said the dumbest thing you're going to say all day, later on you might not be so hesitant to throw out an idea that might actually work. Lastly, while it works as an icebreaker, some of these bad ideas are simply the opposite of good ones–flipping them around is one way to come up with a viable solution you might not have otherwise come up with.”

## 3: Discussion: Diversity, Inclusion and Equal Representation in Technology and Design

### Purpose: 
One of the greatest issues in technology presently is the lack of diversity, inclusion and equal representation. This workshop focuses on the factors that brought the tech (and related STEM fields) to its current state, the pros/cons of diversity or lack thereof and the strategies in place to improve. 
### Topics: 
* What is diversity? Ethnic, socio-economic, gender, ability, health, etc
* Movie night - watch ‘Debugging the Gender Gap’
* Subconscious bias and why VR goggles are sexist
* Reports and statistics regarding diversity and advantage of inclusion + disadvantage to homogeneity 
* Negative consequences that can arise from technical innovation and the importance of diversity on technology teams when designing and testing products: example: hands-free soap dispenser
* What are we doing to make things better? What can we do to include diversity in our work?
