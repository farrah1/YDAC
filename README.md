# Youth Design and Technology Advocacy Committee 
## What is YDAC? 
We, the Youth Design and Technology Committee (YDAC), want to enhance our communities through the use of technology and design principles. We take a by community, for community approach where youth are enabled with skills to enact change with technology and design. 

## How?
From us, it's training workshops, examples and a curriculum that focuses on the possibilities - you don't need to be a technologist to be successful
From them, it's developing projects, workshops, programming independently or with public and private community partners

## Why?

* Technology sector is the fastest growing and has changed the world around us
* The next generation will have grown up with an IoT connected, smart world.
* Programming is being added to K-12 curriculums across Canada.
* Toronto has become an overnight technology capital
* It's cool

## Who is this for? 
Absolutely any youth with an interest in technology: we're taking a no-barriers approach that promotes diversity.
Anyone who sees the potential for technology, but who might not quite understand it. 

## Where?

Youth spaces and their surrounding communities but there's no reason what they develop can't be scaled across the city

## How to sell it

Technology work with no experience needed
An opportunity to gain an incredibly practical and valuable skill set
Great way to meet other people with similar interests and a network of opportunities
