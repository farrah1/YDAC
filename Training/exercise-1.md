## 1: Ice Breaker

- Introduce yourself, why you're interested in getting involved with the city, and what you want to get out of this project

## 2: Introduction to the YDAC

Brief discussion on what the YDAC is, what our goals are for this cohort, what the schedule will look like going forward, and what the upcoming project portion will look like. This is to keep in mind the broader scope when going through the training. 

## 3: Discussion: Ethics and Integrity in Technology and Design

### Purpose: 
This workshop is designed to provide a narrative of ethics and integrity when it comes to working in technology and design. While TD enables us to enhance the world around us, the associated risks to the environment and society are equally impactful. 

### Topics:
